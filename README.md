## Overview

This project applies machine learning to classify breast cancer cases using clinical and imaging-based features. The goal is to improve early detection accuracy while preserving model interpretability, supporting clinical decision-making.

We compare classification models and feature selection strategies, balancing performance and explainability.

## Objectives

- Build a machine learning pipeline for breast cancer classification.
- Compare multiple classifiers and feature selection techniques.
- Use SHAP for explainable AI to visualize feature importance.

---

## Research Questions

1. Can machine learning models accurately classify breast cancer using clinical and imaging features?
2. How does feature selection improve model performance, interpretability, and computational efficiency?
3. Which features are most predictive of malignancy?

## Models Evaluated

- Logistic Regression (baseline)
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Gradient Boosting
- Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)

## Dataset

This project uses the dataset from [Breast Cancer Diagnostic dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imtkaggleteam/breast-cancer)

- **Target**: Diagnosis â€” M (Malignant) or B (Benign)
- **Features**:  
  - Radius, Texture, Perimeter, Area  
  - Smoothness, Compactness, Concavity, Concave Points  
  - Symmetry, Fractal Dimension  

This dataset is widely used for binary classification tasks in medical ML research.
